01-binding_analyses.ipynb: compute fes, errors and orientational analysis

02-hbonds.ipynb. Scripts used to generate output hbonds file, to be analyzed with 03.1-hbonds_analysis.ipynb. Outputs were already generated, but they can be replicated by downloading bound states uploaded on Zenodo.

02.1-hbonds_analysis.ipynb: perform hydrogen bond analysis. It uses weights associated to bound states. These can be extracted by selecting bound states within 2.5kBT of the free energy minimum, for each of the systems.

03-figures.ipynb: sample notebooks which can be used to generate the same figures of the paper.
